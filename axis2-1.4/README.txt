Deploying
===================

To deploy a new Web service in Axis2 the following three steps must 
be performed:
  1) Create the Web service implementation class, supporting classes 
     and the services.xml file, 
  2) Archive the class files into a jar with the services.xml file in 
     the META-INF directory
  3) Drop the jar file to the $AXIS2_HOME/WEB-INF/services directory
     where $AXIS2_HOME represents the install directory of your Axis2 
     runtime. (In the case of a servelet container this would be the
     "axis2" directory inside "webapps".)

To verify the deployment please go to http://<yourip>:<port>/axis2/ and
follow the "Services" Link.

For more information please refer to the User's Guide.
