  <title>Welcome to Apache Axis2 version 1.4</title>
</head>

<body lang="en">
<h1>Welcome to Apache Axis2 version 1.4</h1>

<h3>26-04-2008</h3>

<pre>Just over 8 months since the 1.3 release, we are very proud to
announce the release of Apache Axis2 version 1.4.

Downloads are available at:
    http://ws.apache.org/axis2/download.cgi

Apache Axis2 is a complete re-design and re-write of the widely used
Apache Axis engine and is a more efficient, more scalable, more modular
and more XML-oriented Web services framework. It is carefully designed to
support the easy addition of plug-in "modules" that extend its
functionality for features such as security and reliability.

Modules supporting WS-Security/Secure-Conversation (Apache Rampart),
WS-Trust (Apache Rahas), WS-Reliable Messaging (Apache Sandesha) and
WS-Eventing (Apache Savan) will be available soon after the Apache Axis2
1.4 release. Please see these projects' own sites for further information.

Major Changes Since 1.3:
- Support for JAXWS and JSR 181 Annotations
- Experimental Corba Support
- Fixed tons of small and not-so-small bugs (See list below)

Known Issues and Limitations in 1.4 Release:
- Please see JIRA

We are striving for a simple and happy first time user experience as well as a
satisfying experienced user experience with this release. We welcome any
and all feedback at:
    axis-user@ws.apache.org (please include "[axis2]" in the subject)
    axis-dev@ws.apache.org (please include "[axis2]" in the subject)
    http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AXIS2

Thank you for your interest in Apache Axis2!
